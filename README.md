# Battleship by Amir
The app presents a battleship game in which the user can choose the grid size and play against computer. 
This project has been done as my second portfolio project at Code Institue. JavaScript, HTML and CSS have been used in creating this web-based game.  The users can choose the grid size (or map size) of the game,
    if user chooses 8 or 9 as the grid size ship sizes would be 1 
    if user chooses 10 to 20 as the grid size ship sizes would be based on the original board game from 5 to 2 squares
    the terminal is 24 rows high so the maximum hight and weidth of the game is 20 to better mach the screen
    you can exit the game at any time with pressing Q as row or col.

    Tha app can be on run on the Heroku platform through this link:

# User Experience
## Owner goals
My main purpose of creating this app was to get my project done and present my learning outcomes from Python Essentials course,  I chose to create this game since I used to play it on my phone a few years ago and it was also one of the recommended projects
## User goals
The user may enter the link to play the game against computer in order to be enterntained and beat the computer.
# How the game works:
The player first chooses a grid size as explained above. The ships sizes would vary depending on the grid size chosen by the user. Then, the player starts shooting by choosing the row in letters and column in numbers. If the user manages to sink all the ships before the computer, then, they win. If the computer manages to sink the user's ships sooner than the user then the computer wins.
# Features and Structure of the Website
The app is written in python and is run on heroku platform in a terminal.
# User Interface
There is not a special interface, since the app is run on the terminal and no front-end languages were used.
# Technologies used
### Python
As the language.
### Codeanywhere
As the IDE. However, 70% into the project, my workspace would not open.
### Gitpod
As the alternative IDE after the workspace pn codeanywhere did not open.
### Git
As a version-control system
### Github
As a platform to keep the project files.

# Testing
I used an online tool to control my code with PEP8.

# Issues during development
I had many issues with the codeanywhere platform, same as my last project I got disconnected many times and 70% through the project, my workspace would not open. Luckily, since I had experience from last time. I had a copy of the code, in case anything similar too my last project happpens. I then created the repository again and opened a new workspace on Gitpod which I then used to finish the project.


# Deployment
I used Github to store the app files.
I used heroku online platform to be able to deploy my app on a webpage

# Credits

To complete this project I used Code Institute student template:
https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template

Web and google were very helpful in finding resources for me to learn commands and bit of code that I had not learned about till then. I learned a lot on the web about designing algorithms so that I could create this game.
and of course, the materials that I studied on Code Institute LMS and some points learned on Slack, helped me as well.
